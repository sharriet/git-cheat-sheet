# A cheat sheet for Git workflows

![Git Cheat Sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hbons/git-cheat-sheet/master/preview.png)

Adapted from the original by Hylke Bons, which was based on work by Zack Rusin and SÃ©bastien Pierre.

This adaptation is aimed at students, and the main difference between this and Hylke's version is that the workflow example is simplified, and it also includes a few "Dos and Don'ts".

It could and will most likely undergo further simplifications to make it more accessible to students.
